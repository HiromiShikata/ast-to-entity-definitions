Welcome to `ast-to-entity-definitions`! üéâ This tool lets you easily generate EntityDefinition and EntityPropertyDefinition from your TypeScript type information. By doing this, you can streamline the process of source code generation!

## Getting Started üöÄ

You can start using `ast-to-entity-definitions` by installing it via npm:

```bash
npm install ast-to-entity-definitions
```

Or if you prefer Yarn:

```bash
yarn add ast-to-entity-definitions
```

## Usage üõ†Ô∏è

### CLI

You can use the CLI to generate the EntityDefinition and EntityPropertyDefinition like so:

```bash
npx ast-to-entity-definitions ./src/domain/entities
```

### Function

Alternatively, you can import the `getEntityDefinitions` function and use it in your own scripts:

```typescript
import { getEntityDefinitions } from 'ast-to-entity-definitions/bin/adapter/entry-points/function/index';
console.log(getEntityDefinitions(path));
```

## Examples üîç

This example shows you the output of running `ast-to-entity-definitions` against a TypeScript file. This is a JSON representation of the EntityDefinition and EntityPropertyDefinition for each type:

```javascript
import { execSync } from 'child_process';

describe('commander program', () => {
  it('should output file contents', () => {
    const output = execSync(
      'npx ts-node ./src/adapter/entry-points/cli/index.ts ./testdata/src/domain/entities',
    ).toString();

    console.log(output.trim());
  });
});
```

This example creates EntityDefinitions for a `Administrator`, `Group`, `Item`, `User`, `UserAddress`, and `UserGroup` types.

### Pull Request Requirements

This project uses GitHub Actions to check that pull requests are properly linked to issues. To pass the "Check linked issues in pull requests" validation, you must link your PR to an existing GitHub issue.

**How to link your PR to an issue (choose one method):**

1. **In your PR description** (recommended), include one of these keywords followed by the issue number:

   ```
   Fixes #123
   Closes #456
   Resolves #789
   ```

2. **OR in your commit messages**:

   ```bash
   feat: add new parser functionality

   This commit implements the new parser as requested.

   Fixes #123
   ```

3. **OR using GitHub UI**: You can also link issues manually in the GitHub web interface by clicking "Link an issue" in the PR sidebar.

**Note:** You only need to use ONE of these methods to link your PR to an issue.

**Supported linking keywords:**

- `Fixes #issue-number` - Links and closes the issue when PR is merged
- `Closes #issue-number` - Links and closes the issue when PR is merged
- `Resolves #issue-number` - Links and closes the issue when PR is merged
- `Fix #issue-number` - Links and closes the issue when PR is merged
- `Close #issue-number` - Links and closes the issue when PR is merged
- `Resolve #issue-number` - Links and closes the issue when PR is merged

**For reference only (doesn't close the issue):**

- `Refs #issue-number`
- `References #issue-number`
- `See #issue-number`

**Note:** The linked issue check is currently disabled in this repository (`if: false` in the workflow), but these guidelines should be followed as a best practice and in case the check is enabled in the future.
